1. The program that was executed are:
    a. we run an "echo" command with the argument "hello world from strace"
	because it is inside the prantheses of execve() system call which is responsible for exeuting the programs. 
2. the argument that was passed in is "hello world from strace"
3. file descriptor 1 is the program responsible for printing to the terminal. 
   file descriptor 2 is responsible for printing errors to the terminal. 
4. writing to 1 using 'echo' prints out the arguments to the screen 
	
5. the program prints out "hello world from strace" using echo, so I assume the output is "hello world from strace"
	there are also other outputs such as execve(...) gives 0 and mmap gives a memory location but i'm not sure if i'd count those as 			outputs. 






################## Notes form the man7.org site. ##############################
st_mode = contains the file type and mode
    S_FREG = is the file type constant of a regular file ??

write(int fildes,const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
    returns the size of the string(?) passed

realized mistakes with print_args.c and
